I am a junior student in College of Computer Science, Nankai University. I am currently pursuing my B. Eng. , and will graduate in June, 2024. I am **EAGERLY** looking for a PhD position for 2024 Fall.

My general research interest lies in computer vision and machine learning. To be specific, I focus on 3D vision, neural rendering and applications of vision algorithms and artificial intelligence, such as medical image analysis and human face reconstruction.

I am now working with Prof. [Jin Xie](https://csjinxie.github.io/) on point cloud instance segmentation and Prof. [Yong Qin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kelvin-qin-166b5021) on end-to-end speech to speech translation. Prior to that, I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Qicheng Li](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%E8%B5%B7%E6%88%90-%E6%9D%8E-6a27781a5) on State of Health (SoH) prediction on Li-ion batteries.
